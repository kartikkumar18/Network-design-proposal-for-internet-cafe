The objective of this project is to propose a network design solution for an Internet cafe that needs to support 30 users sharing one ADSL internet connection. The cafe also requires a web filtering device or software to restrict access to inappropriate websites and a billing software to manage customer accounts and usage.


The proposed network design solution takes into consideration the cafe's connectivity and management requirements, as well as its need for secure and reliable internet access. The network design solution includes a requirement analysis, a network diagram, an IP address design, and a list of recommended hardware and software products.


The proposal aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient network infrastructure that meets the cafe's requirements while ensuring a safe and enjoyable browsing experience for its customers. This project is intended to help the cafe owner make informed decisions about their network design and implementation and enable them to provide better services to their customers.
